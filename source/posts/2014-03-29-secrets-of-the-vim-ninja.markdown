I copied the excellent [Vim cheat sheet "Secrets of the Vim Ninja" from Ben
Crowder](http://bencrowder.net/files/vim-fu/) and changed it a bit. I added some
commands and removed the plugins section. Maybe I should add some sort of search
function too.

My version of the [Secrets of the Vim Ninja](/secrets-of-the-vim-ninja) can be
found [here](/secrets-of-the-vim-ninja).
