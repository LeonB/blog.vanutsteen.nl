I've been using Thunderbird with outlook.com / office 365. So basically Thunderbird with Exchange via IMAP.

It's been working relatively well. One little annoyance was that difference in naming folders:

- Trash vs. Deleted Items
- Junk vs. Junk Email
- Sent vs. Sent Items

The `Junk` and `Sent` folder can be renamed in Thunderbird via the GUI but remarkably renaming of the Trash folder is not supported.

I accidentally stumbled upon a link explaining how to change the naming of the trash folder in Thunderbird:
