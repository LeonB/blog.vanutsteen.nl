You see all the nice (resized) images on my site? I've made a plugin for them to be generated. Want I wanted was to add an image in the wordpress editor. Give a height and/or width and that they would be resized automatically.

With proud I introduce my resize plugin: com_resize. Why the name? Because I've used the source code from on of my Joomla! mambots. Hence the name.

You can [download it here](/images/uploads/2008/04/com_resize-01.zip). If you have any question: leave behind a comment.

For installing: just unpack it in the plugins folder andÂ activate the plugin. Your server must have GD installed (or Imagemagick I believe). Maybe I'll release a version with mod_rewrite supported images. But that's only if I'm sore bored I don't what to do else.
