I was trying to use the [Plex Queue extension for chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/myplex-queue-extension/agmheakklldmclgmkfnncddgkiibboil)
for a while but I was having some problems. Every time I tried to use it I got
this error message: `You need to sign in first`.

I tried reinstalling it and that didn't work. Then I tried the Plex It
bookmarklet but that also didn't work.

After some Googling I found out that the problem was with me disabling third
party cookies in Chrome and Chromium. I didn't want to enable third party
cookies again just to use the Plex Queue extension.

Luckily you can whitelist certain sites in Chromium (and Chrome) to allow third
party cookies for a certain site.

In Chrome navigate to the third party cookie settings as follows:

`Setting` > `Show advanced settings` > `Privacy` > `Content settings` > `Cookies`

Then click `Manage exceptions` and add `my.plexapp.com` as a new hostname
pattern. Then click done and voil√°: the Chrome Plex Queue extension works!
