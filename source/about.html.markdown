Hi! I'm Leon and this is my blog! It's mainly about ICT-related stuff I fix and make. So I don’t forget how I got it working

I work at [Tim_online](http://www.tim-online.nl/) as developer/linux-guy. So my living is php but I’m very interested in other languages too (except Perl :p).

At the moment I’m doing Ruby and Python a lot, but that might shift in the future to another language.

I can be found at a lot of different places on the web. Have a look at [www.vanutsteen.nl](http://www.vanutsteen.nl/) for a short list.
